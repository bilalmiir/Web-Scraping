In this project we are accessing faculty data of each campus of FAST (an IT institute in Pakistan). The faculty data includes following attributes:
`'Id'`, `'Name'`, `'Designation'`, `'HEC Approved Supervisor'`, `'Highest Education'`, `'Email'`, `'Department'`, `'Extension Number'` and `'Image URL'`.
